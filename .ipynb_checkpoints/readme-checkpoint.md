This is a simple machine learning project for stock_price_prediction.

In this project first we do data analysis and then feature engineering to make ml model's accuracy better.

There are three machine learning models linear regression, support vector classification and xgbclassifier.

we train and test our data on these three models and all of them give different accuracies.
